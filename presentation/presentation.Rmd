## Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO)
- First-person shooter, released in 2012\
- Games feature two teams of five
  + "Terrorist" (T) versus "counter terrorist" (C)\
- Games consist of two halves (max 15 rounds each)\
  + Quickest possible game: 16-0
  + Longest possible (non-overtime) game: 16-14
  + T & C sides are switched each half
- Popular competitive e-sports scene\
  + 2.74 million viewers in last major tournament
 
## Data scraping
1. Created function to scrape data from a page for a single match between two teams from HLTV (`hltv.org`)
2. Loop to apply that function multiple times for every match registered in HLTV\
    * Each page on `hltv.org` features 100 matches\
    * Function was iterated through over 110 pages\
    * Collected data for 19034 professional games since December 3rd, 2015

## Data preparation
- Data set split into two rows for each game\
  + Each row represents one half of the game
- Percentage  of rounds won by T for each halve represent `tWinPct`, the response variable 
  + If the T side won three rounds in a half versus five for the C side, `tWinPct`$\ =3/8=0.375$

## Data preparation (2)

- Each player represents a single explanatory variable\
  + Obtained a player's rating ($r_i$) for each half from `hltv.org`
    * Based on simple statistics such as kills, assists, deaths, survival rating, damage rating
  + Player on T side = $1/r_i$ (player $T_i$)
    * reciprocal of $r_i$ is taken for T side so that higher coefficient values correspond with higher impact
  + Player on C side = $-r_i$ (player $C_i$)\
    * $-r_i$ used for C side because better performances from the players on C side will result in the T side winning less rounds (response variable)
  + Player not playing in that game = $0$
  
## Data preparation (3)

- Each game in the dataset is played on one of eleven possible "maps"
  + A map is the arena in which a game takes place
  + Different maps may be more or less favorable to the T side
- Dummy variables introduced based on the map a game is played on

- Then, input (explanatory) matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$ contains 2263 player variables and 11 map variables for 38068 observations
  + Each row will have 11 nonzero values: ten players and one map
- Output vector $\boldsymbol{b}$ (`tWinPct`) contains 38068 values

## T Win Rate by Map

```{r}
ggplot(tf,aes(reorder(mapName,-tWinPct),tWinPct,fill=tWinPct)) +
  geom_bar(stat='identity') +
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin=ymin,ymax=ymax),width=0.4, colour="orange", alpha=0.9, size=1.3) +
  geom_hline(yintercept=0.5,size=1) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x='Map Name',y='Proportion of Rounds Won by T Team',
       title='Average T Team Win Percentage vs. Map',
       subtitle='(02/19/2016-12/01/2021)') +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust=0.5),
        plot.subtitle = element_text(hjust=0.5),
        legend.position = 'none') +
  scale_y_continuous(expand=c(0,0), limits = c(0, 0.6))
```

## Data preparation (4)

**Example**

- Game played between team $A$ with players $A_1,A_2,...,A_5$ and a team $B$ with players $B_1,B_2,...,B_5$ on map $M_{10}$ of maps $M_1,M_2,...,M_{11}$.
  + First half: Team $A$ is on side T and wins nine rounds to six
  + Second half: Team $B$ is on side T and wins six rounds to seven
- Then the input matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$ would look like ...
```{r}
knitr::include_graphics(rep('matrix.png'))
```
- And the output vector $\boldsymbol{b}$ would contain two values, $\frac{9}{15}$ and $\frac{6}{13}$.

## Equation

- Now that we have our input matrix $\boldsymbol{A}$ and output vector $\boldsymbol{b}$, we look to estimate the coefficients $\boldsymbol{x}$ such that $\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{A}\boldsymbol{x}=\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{b}$
  + $\boldsymbol{W}$ is the weight vector - it contains 38068 values and simply represents the number of rounds played in a half
  + A 15-0 half should be weighed more than a 1-0 half although they both have the same response variable `tWinPct`

## Ridge Regression

- Method of estimating coefficients in multiple regression when there's a high degree of collinearity among explanatory variables
- Type of regularization: introduces a penalty term that shrinks coefficients towards zero, reducing variance
- Traditional ordinary least squares (OLS) solution for $\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{A}\boldsymbol{x}=\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{b}$ is $\boldsymbol{x}=(\boldsymbol{A}^{T}\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{A})^{-1}\boldsymbol{A}^{T}\boldsymbol{b}$
- Ridge regression solution is $\boldsymbol{x}=(\boldsymbol{A}^{T}\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{A}+\lambda\boldsymbol{I})^{-1}\boldsymbol{A}^{T}\boldsymbol{W}\boldsymbol{b}$ 
  + Ridge parameter ($\lambda$) is a constant that determines the amount of regularization
    * When $\lambda=0$, we have the OLS solution
    * When $\lambda=\infty$, all coefficients are equal to $0$

## Cross Validation

- K-fold cross validation is used to find the optimal $\lambda$ value for the ridge regression solution

```{r}
ggplot(cv,aes(logLambda,mse)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=cv$lambdaOSE[1],color='One Standard\nError Above\nMinimum'),show.legend=T) +
  geom_vline(aes(xintercept=cv$lambdaMin[1],color='Minimum'),show.legend=T) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(x=paste0('log(lambda)'),y='Mean Squared Error',
       title='Cross validation for ridge regression parameter',
       color='  Selection\n  Method') +
  theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5))
```

## Results

- Resulting 2274 coefficients are matched to the 2263 players and 11 maps

```{r}
ggplot(cv2,aes(x=log(lambda),y=value,col=variable)) +
    geom_line(show.legend=F) +
    geom_vline(aes(xintercept=cv$lambdaOSE[1])) +
    theme(legend.position = "none") +
    theme_bw() +
    labs(x='log(lambda)',y='Coefficients',
         title='Change in coefficients for ridge regression parameter') +
    theme(plot.title=element_text(hjust=0.5)) +
    scale_x_continuous(expand=c(0,0), limits = c(min(log(cv2$lambda)), max(log(cv2$lambda))))
```

## Discussion

- Our player evaluation framework combines both contribution to team winning & individual performance
- A similar framework can be used in the future for predictive work
  + Can a similar methodology be used to predict the outcome of CS:GO games? Or can it be used to predict the future performance of CS:GO players?
- Limitation: using a single variable for each player means that a single coefficient estimates their value even if their value fluctuated over the six years studied
  + Perhaps analyze the effect of age on a CS:GO player's performance and weigh their 'peak years' higher
